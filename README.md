# Pandemic-database
----
It is a database coursework. In this coursework, we planned to develop a pandemic monitoring and
management system (PMMS). And we have been appointed to design a database based on the
requirements of the PMMS and provide detailed documentation about its design and usage.
##
 The system is split into
two functional components. The first component records viral test results within the whole
Lukewarm Kingdom. The second component is designed to record and manage citizen travel history. Citizen travel records are used to predict potential areas of virus spread if someone infected has
been wandering around these areas.
